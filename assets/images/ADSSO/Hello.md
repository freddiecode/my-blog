## Using Single Sign-On with Azure AD Connect Cloud Sync

## What is Azure Active Directory Seamless Single Sign-On?

Azure Active Directory Seamless Single Sign-On (Azure AD Seamless SSO) automatically signs users in when they are on their corporate devices connected to your corporate network. When enabled, users don't need to type in their passwords to sign in to Azure AD, and usually, even type in their username. This feature provides your users easy access to your cloud-based applications without needing any additional on-premises components.

I recommend reading my previous blog post, [Deep dive: Hybrid Identity using Azure AD Connect Cloud Sync](https://www.cloudpilot.no/blog/Deep-dive-Hybrid-Identity-using-Azure-AD-Connect-Cloud-Sync/), before continuing with the steps below. 

**The time to migrate from `Azure AD Connect` to `Azure AD Connect Cloud Sync` is now**.

##  Setup 

### Step 1: Download and extract Azure AD Connect files

  1.  Start off by downloading the latest version of [Azure AD Connect](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=47594)
  2. Open a PowerShell window (as administrator) and navigate to the msi file you just downloaded.
  
       *In this guide I have placed the msi file in a new folder named* `AADConnect`*, right below the `C:` drive.*
  
  4.  Run the following: `msiexec /a C:\AADConnect\AzureADConnect.msi /qb TARGETDIR=C:\AADConnect\<Desired name of subfolder>`
  
      *Remember to change the filepath and  name the subfolder to match your file path and desired name*.
      This will extract the files under the new sub-folder named after your choice.
      
      In the example below I extracted the files to a sub-folder named `Extract`.
### Step 2: Import the Seamless SSO PowerShell module

 1. Download and install [Azure AD Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/active-directory/overview)↗️
 
 2. In your PowerShell window, navigate to your `ExtractFolder\Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect` folder.
 
 4. Import the `Seamless SSO` PowerShell module by using this command: `Import-Module .\AzureADSSO.psd1`.

### Step 3: Get the list of Active Directory forest on which Seamless SSO has (already) been enabled

 1. In your PowerShell window (*as you already have successfully imported the* `AzureADSSO` *module in*), call the `New-AzureADSSOAuthenticationContext` cmdlet. When prompted, enter your tenant's *Global Administrator* credentials.
 
 
 3. Next, call the `Get-AzureADSSOStatus` cmdlet. This command provides you with the list of Active Directory forests (look at the "Domains" list in the output) on which this feature has (already) been enabled.

### Step 4: Enable Seamless SSO for each Active Directory forest

1. Call the `Enable-AzureADSSOForest` cmdlet. When prompted, enter the *domain administrator* credentials for the intended Active Directory forest.

>**ℹ️  Note**
>The domain administrator credentials username must the entered in the SAM account name format (example: `mydomain\johndoe` or `mydomain.com\johndoe`).

2. Repeat the preceding step for each Active Directory forest where you want to setup the feature.

### Step 5: Enable the feature on your tenant

To turn on the feature on your tenant, call `Enable-AzureADSSO -Enable $true`.


## Verify

Follow this steps in the Azure portal to verify that you have enabled Seamless SSO correctly:

1. Sign in to the [Azure Active Directory administrative center](https://aad.portal.azure.com/)↗️ with a *Global Administrator* or *Hybrid Identity Administrator* credentials of your tenant.

2. Select **Azure Active Directory** in the left pane. 

3.  Select **Azure AD Connect**.

4. Select **Connect Sync**.

5. Verify that the **Seamless single sign-on** feature appears as **Enabled**.

 ## Roll out the feature 

#### Step 1:

After you have verified that Seamless SSO has been successfully enabled, it's time to roll out the feature to your end-users.

You start by adding the following Azure AD URL to all or selected user's `Intranet zone` settings by using Group Policy in Active Directory:

    https://autologon.microsoftazuread-sso.com  

In addition, you need to enable an Intranet zone policy setting called **Allow updates to status bar via script** through Group Policy.

### Detailed steps

 1. Open the Group Policy Management Editor tool.

 2. Edit the group policy that's applied to some or all your users. This example uses **Default Domain Policy**.

 3. Browse to **User Configuration** > **Policies** > **Administrative Templates** > **Windows Components** > **Internet Explorer** > **Internet Control Panel** > **Security Page**. Then select **Site to Zone Assignment List**.

 4. Enable the policy, and then enter the following values in the dialog box:

 - **Value  name**: `https://autologon.microsoftazuread-sso.com`. 
 The Azure AD URL where the Kerberos tickets are forwarded.
 
- **Value** (Data): `1`. 
This indicates the *Intranet Zone*.

5. Select **OK** and then select **OK** again.

6. Browse to **User Configuration** > **Policies** > **Administrative Templates** > **Windows Components** > **Internet Explorer** > **Internet Control Panel** > **Security Page** > **Intranet Zone**. Then scroll down until you find **Allow updates to status bar via script**. 

7. Enable the policy setting, and then select **OK**.


## Test the feature

To test the feature for a specific user, ensure that all the following conditions are in place:

- The user signs in on a corporate device
- The device is joined to your Active Directory domain. The devices *doesn't* need to be *Azure AD Joined*.
- The device has a direct connection to your Domain Controller (DC), either on the corporate wired or wireless network or via a remote access connection, such as a VPN connection.
- You have rolled out the feature to this user throught Group Policy.

To test the scenario where the user enters only the username,  but not the password:

- Sign in to `https://myapps.microsoft.com`.

To test the scenario where the user doesn't have to enter the username or the password, use one of these steps:

- Sign in to `https://myapps.microsoft.com/Tenantname.onmicrosoft.com`
Replace *Tenantname* with the name of your tenant.

- Sign in to `https://myapps.microsoft.com/domain.com`
Replace *domain.com* with one of your tenants verified domains.

## Disable Single Sign-On

Perform the follwing steps on the on-premises server where you have the `Azure AD Connect Cloud Sync agent` installed:

#### Step 1. Disable the feature on your tenant:

1. You need to have the Azure AD PowerShell module installed. You should already have this in place, as this one is a prerequisite for enabling Single Sign-On in the first place. If you need to re-install it, see guidance found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/active-directory/install-adv2?view=azureadps-2.0)↗️

2. Open a new PowerShell window (as administrator) and navigate to the path where you extracted the files from Azure AD Connect under the **Setup section** in this blog post > **Step 3**.

3. Import the `Seamless SSO` PowerShell module: `Import-Module .\AzureADSSO.psd1`.

4. Call the `New-AzureADSSOAuthenticationContext` cmdlet. A popup windows should open. Log in using either a `Global Administrator` or a `Hybrid Identity Administrator` account.

5. Call `Enable-AzureADSSO -Enable $false` to disable SSO.

#### Step 2. Get a list of AD forests where Seamless SSO has been enabled:

Call `Get-AzureADSSOStatus | Convert-FromJson`. This command provides you with a list of AD forests (look at the "Domains" list) on which this feature has been enabled.

#### Step 3. Manually delete the `AZUREADSSO` computer account from each AD forests that you see listed:

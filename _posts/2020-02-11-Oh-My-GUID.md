### Oh My GUID!


>:information_source: A **Globally Unique Identifier** or GUID is a special type of identifier used in software applications in order to provide a reference number which is unique in any context (hence, "Globally"), for example, in defining the internal reference for a type of access point in a software application, or for creating unique keys in a database.


Here's how you get the ````GUIDs```` from all AD-users in a specific *Organizational Unit* in Active Directory if you haven't got any ````GUIDs```` laying around :wink:
 
````powershell
$OUpath = "OU=Users,OU=cloud-lab,DC=cloudpilot,DC=local"

Get-ADUser -Properties * -Filter * -SearchBase $OUpath | Select-Object -ExpandProperty ObjectGUID |  Export-Csv -Path C:\Temp\GUIDs.csv
````

The code above will result in a nice formatted list. I recommend copying it out or using PowerShells own cmdlet, ````Export-CSV```` for saving it to a file for later use.

After you have successfully saved a list containing your GUIDs, it's time to obtain their ````sAMAccountName````.

**Below you can see my approch to achieve this:**
 
 I make a variable (*called $GUID*) who points to my newly exported CSV-list containing all my GUIDs.
 Then I use a ````foreach-loop```` who iterates through every GUID in my list, obtaining the AD-user it belongs to, and then saves it to my $ADuser variable. 

For convenience I've put in a simple ````Write-Host```` at the end. It writes out the ````sAMAccountName```` and their corresponding ````GUID````. Handy to have both values at the same line.

````powershell
$GUID = Import-CSV C:\Temp\GUIDs.csv

foreach ($G in $GUID) {

$ADuser = Get-ADUser "$($G.GUID)"

Write-Host "GUID for user $($ADuser.samAccountName) is $($ADuser.ObjectGUID)"

}
````
